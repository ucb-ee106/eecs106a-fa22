Hi there, folks! We're happy to have you in C106A/206A this semester, and despite it being an unprecedented one, we're sure that this semester will be engaging and enriching! We'll be posting weekly announcements to keep you up to date on what's cracking. This week's will be particularly long, since we're all getting started. 


===GENERAL COURSE INFORMATION===

The course website has the weekly schedule (lectures, labs, discussions, office hours, HW party), semester schedule, and resources. On the Semester Schedule, you'll find each week's homeworks and labs released. Please read the Policies page for more details on the course. Visit the course website here: https://ucb-ee106.github.io/106a-fa20site/ 

 The course Gradescope will be used for submitting all assignments. You can join with the code: MJZ8V6

 The course Piazza will be used for answering questions, communicating most information, and releasing homework solutions. Find it here: https://piazza.com/class/kdureom7avo7lf?cid=5

 All course Zoom meetings will be held here: https://berkeley.zoom.us/s/92057520341 You MUST register for this meeting before the first lecture (we don't want Zoombombers!), so please do this before our first lecture. This meeting will hold all lectures, office hours, labs, discussions, and homework parties.

 If you have any logistical concerns, please email Stella at seo.jysk@

===THIS WEEK===

This class kicks off with our first lecture is on 08/27 @3:30pm. We look forward to seeing you there!
 HW 0 (a review of linear algebra) will be released 08/26 @5pm and is due 09/01 @11:59pm. 

 Lab 0 (Setting Up a VM) will be released with HW 0, and its completion is required for you to begin Lab 1 (starting 08/31). There are no lab sections for Lab 0.

 Lab placements will be released by Friday 08/28 9am. Please fill out this form to facilitate lab placements. It is due Thursday 08/27 11:59pm. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnZNbope9kUPEffm_ekPFfOgZaaeUdFMqW01hkt34igG4gjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link   

 We will also enable the Piazza "Find teammates" function so you can find a lab partner in your section!
 Having difficulty with HW 0 or Lab 0? Office hours start on 08/27 @5pm. Please remember to go to the appropriate office hours (HW to Content OH, labs to Lab OH). 


 There will be no HW Party this week. HW Party begins on 09/04.

 A peek into the future: Monday 09/07 is Labor Day, and there will be no labs. If you are in a Monday section, you are welcome to join any lab section that week that works for you. Please understand that help and checkoff queues that week will be a little slower to accommodate Monday students.
