Happy first full week of classes! Here are some things to note for this week:

Please check your lab assignments here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cd9YgQoSsQwVoTYwFRdCVEBXjFlHXlcQfK9C2p6FzLs/edit?usp=sharing  If you have any concerns, please email me!

HW 0 is due Tues 09/01 11:59pm Pacific time

HW 1 will be released Wed 09/02 around 5pm. We have our first Homework Party on Friday, so swing by then for dedicated homework help.

Discussions also begin this week! Based on the pre-semester scheduling jamboree, we have decided to cancel the 2-3pm discussion. We will only have Fri 12-1pm, 1-2pm, and 3-4pm discussion sections. If you cannot attend any of these sections, do not fret! We will post the worksheet and a recorded discussion online on the course website.

Readings for this week’s lectures have been uploaded on the course website under Semester Calendar.

Lab 1 begins this week with an Introduction to ROS. For asynchronous students, please view the mini-lecture here: https://youtu.be/SwZ9qcO-jOc

If you’re looking for a little bit more framework to get started on class materials, please check out these resources on the Resources page: Ron’s ROS Basics (Video), Tiffany’s Python & NumPy Crash Course (Video) (Slides), Stella’s Linux Bootcamp: (Video) (Slides), Amay’s Linear Algebra Review (Document), Jay’s Lab 0 Walkthrough (Video)

If you are a DSP student, please email me so we can set up a time to discuss the accommodations you will need this semester.
