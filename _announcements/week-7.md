title: Week 7 Announcements
---

Week 7!! Look at how far you've come and all the things you've learned despite the obstacles posed by remote learning. Even though you might be in the middle of midterm season, remember to take time to breathe and take care of you.

===LAB=== 

This week, you'll start Lab 6 which is an introduction to computer vision. The video for asynchronous students is here. 

We're in the middle of Module 2. Next week is buffer week. Labs 5 & 6 are due before the start of your lab section on the week of 10/26. Do not postpone your checkoffs til buffer week! Or the week after!

We made a Discord for you all to chat and discuss the labs! We know that it can be frustrating in a remote semester to not be able to ask the person sitting next to you for some quick clarifications. It looks like our Piazza threads aren't super popular, and we suspect it might be because it feels awkward and high-effort to ask on Piazza for something that could be pretty straightforward. For these reasons, we created this Discord, and you can join using this link: https://discord.gg/smUaBv4 

- There are two voice channels for even & odd numbered labs (we think it might be useful to split this way based on our module system). There's also a text-based chat for lab questions. 
- There's HW text in case you want to ask questions of each other about HW approaches. 
- And a random channel in case you want to play a quick game of Among Us or skribbl.io for an element of social fulfillment :) 
- Friendly reminder to be kind and courteous to each other on this platform!

Please remember that you can email TAs to ask if you can attend their section! You need not be present for all of it, and you can take advantage of this time to get checked off. You can check the Lab Assignments sheet to see which sections have fewer students and more room. In particular, Ron's Tuesday and Thursday sections are fairly empty. 

===LECTURE===

Readings for this week have been posted to the course website. 

This week, lectures will be delivered by Valmik Prabhu, one of Professor Sastry's PhD students and the former Head TA for the course. The format will be largely similar to previous lectures.

===HOMEWORK===

HW 5 is due Tues 10/13 11:59pm.
HW 6 will be released Wed 10/14 around 5pm. It will be due 10/20 11:59pm. 

HW Party will now be on Gather! Please RSVP using this form if you intend on coming. This is necessary so that we can pay for the most relevant plan that can accommodate everybody. Please RSVP by Thursday 11:59pm.

===MIDTERM===

Midterm regrade requests will close 10/16 11:59pm. We will not visit these until after the window closes, so please be thorough in your requests. 

Thank you for all your feedback from the post-midterm feedback form! We will announce some of the common threads we found in your responses and the way we plan on tackling some of the issues you've raised. 

===FINAL PROJECT===

Thanks for your mini-proposal submissions :) We'll be reading through them this week, and we will meet with you next week (during lab buffer week) to discuss some feedback. 

If there's a specific TA that you'd like feedback from, please let me know by emailing me at seo.jysk@

===GENERAL===

Zoom link for everything: https://berkeley.zoom.us/s/92057520341 

Professor Sastry's OH this week have been cancelled.

Please remember to be kind and courteous to each other. We know that it's an unusual semester and that patience can wear thin during such psychologically taxing times. However, this is not an excuse for rudeness. We've noticed an alarming number of (micro)aggressions against students and TAs this semester. This class is to be a safe, supportive learning space for all students. Please help us maintain it that way. (And of course, there's the added bonus of +2% for EPA!)
