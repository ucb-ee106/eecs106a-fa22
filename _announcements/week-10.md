title: Week 10 Announcements
---

Week 10! We made it to the double digits! Incredible!!!

==LAB== 

- This week, we're introducing Lab 8, in which you build an occupancy grid with STDR! The lab doc is on the course website and you can view the video for asynchronous students from the link on Piazza. This is the last lab of the semester!!
- We're in the heart of Module 3! Remember that we have buffer week after this, and then we'll be converting lab hours to office hours by appointment.
- The labs will again be due before the start of what WOULD be your lab section the week after buffer week. - We highly encourage everyone to finish their checkoffs during buffer week so you don't stress about checkoffs during exam week. 
- If you don't get checked off during or before buffer week, you will need to sign up for an appointment for checkoff.
- If you are in Ron's Tuesday section: if you are unable to attend lab section because you're out voting, no worries. Please email any of the other TAs of the sections you can attend and let them know that you will be attending their section instead this week.
- Please use your real names instead of gamer tags on Discord to foster a little bit more sense of community.
- Please remember that you can email TAs to ask if you can attend their section! You need not be present for all of it, and you can take advantage of this time to get checked off. You can check the Lab Assignments sheet to see which sections have fewer students and more room. In particular, Ron's Tuesday and Thursday sections are fairly empty. 

==HOMEWORK== 

- HW 8 is due WED 11/04 11:59pm.

- Please vote if you are eligible!

==LECTURE==

- Tuesday's lecture will be recorded as always, so if you need to miss class to vote, that's okay!
- Thank you for your feedback on why some of you aren't coming to live lecture! We appreciate your honesty! We sincerely hope that you do come to the special topics lectures after Midterm II where the material will be more fun and lighter. In particular, I'm super stoked about the guest lectures from Rob and Jaspal we have lined up. As a reminder, here's some info about them below:
- 11/24: Robert Peter Matthew is a former TA for the course and currently a project partner for a few final project teams. He's currently an Assistant Professor at UCSF, and he works in the intersection of robotics and health. I've had the honor of working in the same lab as him, and he does some truly incredible and meaningful work. I highly encourage you to attend this guest lecture live for maximum benefit as he shares how concepts from this class are so applicable to the impactful work he does now. 
- 12/01: Jaspal Sandhu is perhaps the most influential professor I've had at Cal. Though he's a mechanical engineer by training, he currently works in the public health sphere through the lens of human-centered design. I'm hoping that his lecture will broaden your understanding of design and give some context for the work that we do as engineers. We ask that you turn on your cameras for this guest lecture and do some short readings to ensure that this lecture is more of a conversation and discussion about some important topics. 

==MIDTERM==

- All midterm regrade requests have been resolved!
- Thanks for your patience! I reviewed all the feedback from the survey and wanted to release the document linked on Piazza that highlights some of the big, repetitive concerns we've seen pop up.

==FINAL PROJECT==

- Your final proposal will be graded by 11:59pm! They will also be reviewed by Professor Sastry, though we cannot guarantee by what date.
- After Lab Module 3, we will convert all lab hours to office hours by appointment. Just so you can get thinking about which TAs to ask questions that might be relevant to your projects, please find on Piazza the spreadsheet with TA and Lab Assistant specializations. 
- Get started on your final projects as early as you can! It's a hefty part of your grade. Remember that you must complete a final project to receive a passing grade in the course. 

==GENERAL==

- Zoom link for everything: https://berkeley.zoom.us/s/92057520341 
- Please remember to be kind and courteous to each other. We know that it's an unusual semester and that patience can wear thin during such psychologically taxing times. However, this is not an excuse for rudeness. This class is to be a safe, supportive learning space for all students. Please help us maintain it that way. (And of course, there's the added bonus of +2% for EPA!)
- We know it's getting to the point of the semester when energy levels dip. Hang in there! You're doing amazing, and we are so proud of you for making it this far!
