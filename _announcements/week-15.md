Hey there, guys, gals, and nonbinary pals! 

You've done it! You've survived! Fall 2020 as a semester is over!!! School in general is hard, but this semester really was something else. It's been one super crazy, very stressful, kind of chaotic sequence of months, and I hope you're all taking time to take care of you after all of this. Like--for real. I hope you give yourself a pat on the back, grab something tasty, and do something you love. 

I wanted to give you all a few last updates before sending you off!

And that's it! That's my last announcement for the semester. I'm sure I speak for all of course staff when I say it was an honor and a privilege to have been a part of your robotics journey. We've loved seeing you learn and grow and honestly blossom, despite all of the difficulties of the semester. We've enjoyed every minute of office hours, labs, and project meetings with each of you. I have no doubts that this semester had its moments of frustration and fatigue, but I hope when you look back on it as a whole, it was a worthwhile struggle. Look how far you've come--from knowing little to nothing about ROS and probably little robotics theory to being able to build projects like the ones you've submitted? That's crazy! That's nuts! You're incredible! 

We've been really lucky to have students like you. Thank you for your time--and I mean it. We see the hours you've put into every assignment. We applaud your ambition, your work ethic, and your drive. Whether or not you decide to continue in robotics, we hope this class was worthwhile (hopefully even fun!) and that you won't be a stranger if you see us around campus. 

Good luck on all your future endeavors! We're rooting for you.

Congratulations, y'all. You've made it!
- Your C106A TAs
